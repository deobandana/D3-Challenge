                            DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT



This project uses D3.js to visualize state-level data information on population health retrieved from the U.S. Census data. It similates an on-line newpaper article with an interactive visualization. Three risk factors (obesity, smoking, and uninsurance rates) are plotted against three underlying factors which are income, poverty rate, and age.

          <p>We examined the outcome for state-level data of obesity, smoking, and uninsured (healthcare) percentages based on three factors, poverty level (percentage below poverty line), median age, and median household income based per one hundred thousand people.
          </p>

          <p>We found a positive correlation between poverty levels and levels of unisured individuals. We see similar correlations with smoking and obesity levels. However, the link between obesity and poverty is less pronounced. For example, in Colorado, where poverty levels are slightly below average, obesity is the lowest. In contrast, New Hampshire with the lowest poverty rate has not the lowest obesity level. Despite this, we cannot but note that people who live in the most poverty-dense states of the United States are most prone to obesity. Conversely, as expected, we see negative correlations between all three outcomes and median household income. This tracks with the poverty correlations, as in general, we expect the poverty percentage to decrease as median household income increases.
          </p>

          <p>We see no visible correlation between median age and obesity and smoking rates. There might be a weak negative correlations between median age and the uninsured percentage of the population.  This might be due to the presence of government healthcare programs for older individuals. 
          </p>

          <p>It is interesting to note a few other extreme values.  Texas has by the highest uninsured rate.  It, and Georgia, stand out, even accounting for income level.  In a different category, Utah has the lowest percentage of smokers among all states. This is perhaps due to Mormonism, which support abstinnence from various substances such as caffeine, alcohol, or tobacco.  We cannon to note in aditon, Utah is also the youngest state by median age.
